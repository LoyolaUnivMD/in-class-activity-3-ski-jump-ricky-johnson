Introduce program

// User Inputs
Ask user for hill type (string)
Ask user for jumper's speed (int)

// Determine correct calculation based on hill type
if hill type is normal
    height = 46
    distance = jumper's speed * time in air (sqrt((2*height)/9.8))
    points = 60 + (distance - 90) * 2

    // Output
    Print points and distance
    if points >= 61
        print "Great job for doing better than par!"
    else if points < 10
        print "What happened??"
    else
        print “Sorry, you didn’t go very far.”

else if hill type is large
    height = 70
    distance = jumper's speed * time in air (sqrt((2*height)/9.8))
    points = 60 + (distance - 120) * 1.8

    // Output
    Print points and distance
    if points >= 61
        print "Great job for doing better than par!"
    else if points < 10
        print "What happened??"
    else
        print “Sorry, you didn’t go very far.”
