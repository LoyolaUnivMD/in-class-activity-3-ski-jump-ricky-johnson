Introduce program

// User Inputs
Ask user for hill type (string)
Ask user for jumper's speed (int)

// Determine correct calculation based on hill type
if hill type is normal
    distance = jumper's speed * time in air (sqrt((2*46)/9.8))
    points = 60 + (distance - 90) * 2
else if hill type is large
    distance = jumper's speed * time in air (sqrt((2*70)/9.8))
    points = 60 + (distance - 120) * 1.8

// Output
Print points and distance

if points >= 61
    print "Great job for doing better than par!"
else if points < 10
    print "What happened??"
else
    print “Sorry, you didn’t go very far.”
